//! The IBM Cloud App Configuration Rust SDK is used to perform feature flag and property
//! evaluation based on the configuration on IBM Cloud App Configuration service.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! [IBM Cloud App Configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/app-configuration) is a centralized
//! feature management and configuration service on [IBM Cloud](https://www.cloud.ibm.com) for
//! use with web and mobile applications, microservices, and distributed environments.
//!
//! Instrument your applications with App Configuration Rust SDK, and use the App Configuration
//! dashboard, API or CLI to define feature flags or properties, organized into collections and
//! targeted to segments. Change feature flag states in the cloud to activate or deactivate features
//! in your application or environment, when required. You can also manage the properties for distributed
//! applications centrally.
//!
//! # Pre-requisites
//!
//! You will need the `apikey`, `region` and `guid` for the AppConfiguration you want to connect to
//! from your [IBMCloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! **Note.-** This crate is still under heavy development. Breaking changes are expected.
//!
//! Create your client with the context (environment and collection) you want to connect to
//!
//! ```
//! use appconfiguration_rust_sdk::{
//!     AppConfigurationClient, AppConfigurationClientIBMCloud, IBMCloudContext,
//!     Entity, Result, Value, Feature
//! };
//! # use std::collections::HashMap;
//! # pub struct MyEntity;
//! # impl Entity for MyEntity {
//! #   fn get_id(&self) -> String {
//! #     "TrivialId".into()
//! #   }
//! #   fn get_attributes(&self) -> HashMap<String, Value> {
//! #     HashMap::new()
//! #   }
//! # }
//! # fn func() -> Result<()> {
//! # let apikey: &str = "api_key";
//! # let region: &str = "us-south";
//! # let guid: &str = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abcd";
//!
//! // Create the client connecting to the server
//! let ibm_context = IBMCloudContext::new("production", "ecommerce");
//! let client = AppConfigurationClientIBMCloud::new(&apikey, &region, &guid, ibm_context)?;
//!
//! // Get the feature you want to evaluate for your entities
//! let feature = client.get_feature("AB_testing_feature")?;
//!
//! // Evaluate feature value for each one of your entities
//! let user = MyEntity; // Implements Entity
//!
//! let value_for_this_user = feature.get_value(&user)?.try_into()?;
//! if value_for_this_user {
//!     println!("Feature {} is active for user {}", feature.get_name()?, user.get_id());
//! } else {
//!     println!("User {} keeps using the legacy workflow", user.get_id());
//! }
//!
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
